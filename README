About Light Gun XR
------------------
Light Gun XR exists to serve two purposes. The first is to make light gun
games playable on PC via VR controllers, and the second is to give the author
a place to research XR as part of the development of SDL_ActionSet:

TL;DR: This is a fun toy project to help justify VR's immense cost of entry.

Dependencies
------------
Light Gun XR depends on libc, OpenXR, and the uinput Linux kernel module.
